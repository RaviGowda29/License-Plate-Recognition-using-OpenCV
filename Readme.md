### License Plate Recognition using OpenCV

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on real-time detection and recognition of license plates using OpenCV and EasyOCR. By employing advanced image processing techniques and machine learning, we aim to achieve high accuracy in recognizing letters and numbers from various license plates.

**Components**  
1. **Image Preprocessing**: The project includes robust preprocessing steps, such as converting images to grayscale, applying blur filters, and enhancing images for better text localization.
   
2. **Edge Detection and Contour Finding**: It utilizes edge detection methods to localize text, followed by contour detection to identify regions of interest within the image.

3. **EasyOCR Integration**: EasyOCR is employed for optical character recognition, effectively reading letters and numbers from the isolated license plate regions, even in challenging conditions.

**Steps to Follow**  
1. **Install and Import Dependencies**: Set up a Jupyter environment and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   conda create -n lpr_env python=3.8
   conda activate lpr_env
   pip install jupyter opencv-python easyocr matplotlib
   ```

2. **Load and Preprocess Image**: Read the image, convert it to grayscale, and apply a blur filter.

3. **Edge Detection**: Apply filters and edge detection to localize text or features of interest.

4. **Contour Detection**: Detect contours and apply a mask to isolate the relevant areas.

5. **Text Recognition**: Use EasyOCR to read the text from the masked regions, benefiting from its deep learning capabilities.

**Result**  
Display or save the recognized text and processed images, showcasing the effectiveness of the system.

**Installation Instructions**  
Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed to create the environment. Follow the steps above to set up your Jupyter environment and install the necessary packages.

**Usage**  
Provide examples or instructions on how to use the project, demonstrating its application in real-world scenarios.
